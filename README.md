## Umbrella World
You are the security guard stationed at a secret underground installation. You want to know whether it’s raining today, 
but your only access to the outside world occurs each morning when you see the director coming in with, or without, an
umbrella.

## Forward-Backward Algorithm
* **Category**: Dynamic programming
* **Goal**: Inference

The forward–backward algorithm is an inference algorithm for hidden Markov models which computes the posterior marginals of all hidden state variables given a sequence of observations/emissions.
This inference task is usually called smoothing.

#### Steps
1. Compute forward probabilities
2. Compute backward probabilities
3. Compute smoothed values

## Terms
**Dynamic programming**: simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner.
